		<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
			<h4 class="green bigger">The Problem</h4><p><span class="small">Arts education is not available in the majority of Romanian schools serving less privileged communities, and we are actively identifying these schools to address this need. School principals have been very supportive of our initiative and are willing to cooperate in implementing our programs as extracurricular activities. Our pilot classes in acting and public speaking involved 50 children from the elementary and middle school in Sura Mica, the Sibiu County. The classes raised a lot of enthusiasm among all constituencies, from children to parents, to participating teachers and instructors, and to the larger local community. A press release in Tribuna, the main Sibiu journal, announced our programs and also mentioned our involvement in holiday celebrations for the people of Sura Mica and the nearby villages.</span></p>

			<h4 class="green bigger">The Future</h4><p><span class="small">Our future programs will continue to enroll children 6 to 14 years of age and will provide instruction in instrumental music, acting, public speaking, and visual arts. The activities will be tailored to each community and coordinated with the local schools and youth bureaus, as well as with the local artist associations. For this purpose, we reached out to several elementary and middle schools in Romania and we built these relationships to successfully launch our programs after the first round of fundraising in 2014. At the same time, we contacted performing artists interested in collaborating with us and willing to participate as instructors for our programs. We see the role of local artists as a dual component of our mission: while engaging in our programs, the artists provide expert instruction and, at the same time, find a source of income in a profession generally known for its low monetary rewards. By supports local artists, we will furthermore enrich the exposure of the large community to cultural and artistic events.</span></p>
			<h4 class="green bigger">Long Term Goals</h4><p><span class="small">With the goal of becoming self-sustainable, the organization will promote programs that encourage an entrepreneurial way of thinking and living. Children have the right to seek and find their talents and grow up with a sense of confidence in all the opportunities availble. The idea that one can do something on his/her own is extremely powerful and, encouraged from an early age, it will set a positive and adaptive attitude for the entire life.</span></p>
